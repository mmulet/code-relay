            Open source maintainers are the heart and soul of open source. They
            are the ones who lead and/or own open source projects. This is page
            is all about how Code Relay can help out Maintainers.

          It's no question that open source has become work. The same boring
          work you have to do at the office
          <ul>
            <li>Working with contributors instead of colleagues</li>
            <li>Internet politics instead of office politics</li>
            <li>And you still have to do the same grunt/busy work</li>
          </ul>
          But in open-source, there is no paycheck (or a very tiny one) waiting
          for you at the end of each week. It's no wonder why so many open
          source maintainers burn out and lose their passion.
        </p>
        <h2>Code Relay is here to fix that!</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No more recruiting and onboarding contributors.</li>

        </ul>
        Just set up your tasks and you are good to go.

        <h2>Rules:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Your repository must be licensed with an Open source initiative
            approved license<a href="#star">*</a>{" "}
            <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">License</a>
            <div>
              This includes the most popular licenses you've ever heard of, such
              as BSD, GPL, or MIT licenses.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Your code must be a public repository hosted on GitHub
            <a href="#star-star">**</a> <a href="github.com">github.com</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, this isn't a rule, but a strong suggestion: Please include
            the words: "Made with CodeRelay.io" at the top of your repo's
            README.md
            <p>
              The more people know about Code Relay, the more people will
              contribute, and the better it is for all maintainers, including
              you.
